We, the data scientists, were assigned the objective by the Finance Department to create the best model with the capability to predict if a company will file for bankruptcy in the future. Holding an investment position in a company that files for bankruptcy can lead to major monetary losses, and the Finance Department would like to avoid this negative scenario by selling investment positions if a company will likely to file for bankruptcy. The Finance Department specifically stated they do not care about predicting the year a company will go bankrupt, just if the company will file or not; we will not be using time as a variable.
